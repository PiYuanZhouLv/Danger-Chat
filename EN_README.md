# Danger Chat
A simple dangerous message system.
## Why is it called "Danger Chat"?
First, because the prototype of this program is very dangerous, the information is easy to be peeped and modified. (of course, it's much safer now)

Secondly, the web is the most dangerous place, and the security problem should not be underestimated. In order to alert developers including me, it is named "Danger Chat".

**Not because it sounds like WeChat**_(WeChat and Danger Chat have the same pronounce in Chinese)_
## Can I modify my code offline?
In theory, this is not my jurisdiction. You can change the code you download as you want.

**But**
* **Please maintain the user's information security**
* **Please do not release the modified program in the name of "original code"**
* **Please do not tarnish the reputation of the original project**

If it is not necessary, I hope you will not destroy the original content and functions in the process of modification.

*If you would like, you can open an issue with "extend used" tag and attach your project address; At the same time, attach the project address to your project*
